The parts have been split to accommodate a 250 build plate.
The canopy is created from a single flat sheet of PETG which is formed with no heat into shape by the end gables. I have revised the end gable design to put less stress on the PETG canopy, please see this thread: ⁠user-mods⁠3D Printed Top Hat\Lid for the…
The gable end windows are made out of 3mm thick. Acrylic discs which have a flat cut off them. I have included a marking jig to mark off the end panels.
I have included supports where required, they are coloured green in the CAD.
I have also included 2 versions of the cross members for either the stock or euro style extrusion profiles.
An additional slightly modified corner post to match the chamfer detail of the End Gables, this is symmetrical and a direct swap for the stock corner post.

Assemble the inner liners (orange parts & the cross members to form a frame. Leave the inner and outer parts of the cross members loose to allow easy insertion of the PETG sheet.
Insert the PETG sheet into the rear slot until it bottoms.
Bend the sheet over the orange formers and insert the front of the sheet into the front slot.
Fix the End Gable frames (red) to the inner frames (orange), fixing from the inside.
Tighten the cross member assemblies once the canopy is fully fixed & rigid.
You may need to loosen things off a bit and retighten to get the base of the frame level to the BT frame.
